# AAPL-Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Forecasting

This project provides a deep dive into predicting Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using a Stacked LSTM model, a powerful neural network design for handling sequential and time series data. The project is structured to guide users from data collection through to model deployment, providing insights and actionable forecasts for AAPL stock trends.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to forecast AAPL stock prices by:
1. Conducting a thorough data analysis to understand historical stock trends.
2. Developing a Stacked LSTM model tailored for time series forecasting.
3. Generating accurate predictions and visualizations to aid in strategic decision-making.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Using the Tingo API, AAPL historical stock data is gathered and stored in a CSV file for reproducibility.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaning, organizing, and normalizing the data to ensure model efficiency.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualizing price trends and uncovering seasonal patterns.
   - Using graphs and moving averages to observe fluctuation patterns over time.

4. **Model Development**:  
   - Building a Stacked LSTM model, which includes multiple LSTM layers to better capture complex sequential dependencies.
   - Training the model with historical data and optimizing for prediction accuracy.

5. **Prediction and Forecasting**:  
   - Utilizing the trained model to forecast stock prices for a given period.
   - Visualizing and comparing forecasted prices with real data to validate the model's predictive power.

6. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Performance metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), are used to gauge model accuracy.
   - Results are visualized to help assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

## Important Findings

- Historical data highlights recurring patterns, indicating seasonality in AAPL stock prices.
- The Stacked LSTM model successfully identifies these trends, demonstrating strong predictive potential, especially in the short term.
- External economic factors not present in the dataset may impact prediction accuracy in real-world applications.

## Conclusion

Machine learning, specifically LSTM, offers a promising approach to stock price forecasting. While results show that the model is well-suited for capturing trends, incorporating broader economic indicators and experimenting with other model architectures could further enhance accuracy.

## Usage Notes

- **Customization**: We can Modify parameters like the training window or LSTM layers to tailor the model for different forecasting needs.
- **Future Improvements**: We can cConsider adding other market indicators (e.g., trading volume, news sentiment) to enrich predictions.

With a strong model foundation and insights from historical trends, this project provides a useful tool for understanding and predicting AAPL stock price movements.
